    <h2> Personal information</h2>
    <p>
      Hello my name is <strong>Olivie Bizimana</strong>, I'm currently a Syracuse University
      Student. I'm attending the University for the major of Information
      Management and technology with Two Concentrations of information Security
      and Data Analytics. I took a liking to the major because of its
      advancement capability and also because tech is the new future.

      So far since attending syracuse i've learned multiple programming
      languages such as Python, SQL, R & R studio, HTML, CSS, and a touch of
      javascript.i've worked on a few project, so far i've done statistical
      Analytics on a electricity consumptions for an entire neighborhood using
      R, i've made a python recommendation program for places to visit which
      also included things such as sentiment analysis, weather data, location
      API’S, and even ratings of the places nearby. I've created a website using
      HTML & CSS a while back as well. I've spent the past summer studying for
      the COMP TIA A+ Certification exam and I'm hoping to also get the Security
      + Certificate as well.
